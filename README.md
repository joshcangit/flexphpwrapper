# flexphpwrapper
PHP wrappers will multiple ways to use and multiple versions to choose from.

### Check out the other branches for different versions of these wrappers.
The **`master`** branch has wrappers that need an instance to access the class except from within the class or another class it is extended from.

The **`classless`** branch has wrappers that are usable with needing to access a class.

The **`static`** branch has wrappers that are similar to the `master` branch except, there is no need to declare an instance to access the class.

Each branch has 2 wrappers, one for the **MySQLi** extension and the other for the **PDO** extension.
